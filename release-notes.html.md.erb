* <%= vars.product_abbr %> now adds security metadata for `CREATE` and `CHMOD` events on Linux.
For more information, see [Metadata](./installing.html#metadata).

* <%= vars.product_abbr %> can be configured to keep track of file metadata using an in-memory cache on Linux.
Enabling this feature will use more memory, but can limit the number of redundant file events being logged.

### Known Issues

This release has the following known issue:

* The **`user`** and **`group`** metadata fields may not be accurate for files in containers on PAS/PKS.
However, the proper username and group name can be determined using the **`uid`** and **`gid`** metadata fields.
