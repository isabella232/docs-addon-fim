<strong><%= modified_date %></strong>

This documentation describes setting up and using <%= vars.product_full %> (<%= vars.product_abbr %>).

## <a id='overview'></a>Overview

<%= vars.product_full %> provides logs of file and directory modifications in monitored paths.
Operators and auditors use these logs to satisfy security requirements for file integrity monitoring
for <%= vars.ops_manager %>-managed BOSH VMs.

You can use <%= vars.product_abbr %> to help achieve compliance standards such as the Payment Card Industry
Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) or the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA).

## <a id='features'></a>Key Features

<%= vars.product_short %> enables you to:

* Monitor <%= vars.ops_manager %>-managed BOSH VMs and containers
* Specify path patterns to exclude
* Group path patterns under low severity
* Format log output
* Provide digest calculations of files

## <a id='snapshot'></a> Product Snapshot

The following table provides version and version-support information about <%= vars.product_abbr %>.

## <a id="limitations"></a>Limitations

<%= vars.product_short %> has the following limitations:

* Windows support is in beta
* If you are upgrading from <%= vars.product_abbr %> v1.4, you must manually uninstall the runtime configs.
For more information, see [Upgrading <%= vars.product_short %>](./uninstalling.html).

###<a id="bcaf"></a>BOSH Context Adaptor for FIM (BCAF)

The BOSH Context Adaptor for FIM (BCAF) is a feature that reduces the number of logs that an operator needs to review. It does this by notifying the Event Logger of BOSH events, and lowers the severity of those events, to allow Operators to focus on high severity events.

This is done by observing what is logged by the BOSH Agent, which is located at `/var/vcap/bosh/log/current`. Once the BOSH Agent receives an event from the BOSH Director, the Agent starts generating logs corresponding to the events. BCAF will analyze the start and end of the events, and lower the severity of any BOSH-related paths in the Event Logger. These events are then output into `/var/vcap/sys/log/fim/fim.stdout.log`.

This diagram illustrates how the BOSH Context Adaptor analyzes BOSH events:

[//]: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/18BpGdRZVkZmdiWhkU-0mc0z0t_p02NT6B0X4kv6Ii_c/edit#slide=id.g84f09073e3_0_58
![INSERT ALT TEXT HERE](arch-bcaf.png)

In this example, the BOSH Director starts an event and sends it to the BOSH Agent.
The BOSH Agent sends the `mkdir` and `touch` events to `fsnotify` and begins to log in the BOSH Agent log:

    TimeStamp 1: BOSH event started
    ...
    ...
    ...
    ...
    TimeStamp ?: BOSH event finished

BCAF analyzes the events taking place in the BOSH Agent log.
It observes that `/var/vcap/alice` and `bob.txt` are related during the `mkdir` event.
The Context Adaptor notifies the Event Logger that these are BOSH events and changes the severity level to `3`.

The log output from the Event Logger reflects this change:

    ...
    ...
    /var/vcap/alice is created [it is related to a normal BOSH event && severity is LOW]
    ...
    bob.txt is created [it is related to a normal BOSH event && severity is LOW]
    ......

For an example log message, see [Example of Log Message Identified by BCAF](./log-examples.html#container-examples).
