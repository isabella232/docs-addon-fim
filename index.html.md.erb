<strong><%= modified_date %></strong>

The File Integrity Monitoring Add-on for PCF (FIM Add-on) may be necessary for regulatory purposes if your compliance auditor 
requires File Integrity Monitoring (FIM) protection within the PCF environment. 

For example, auditors sometimes expect that FIM protection be present in an environment that must comply with standards 
such as Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) or Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act 
(HIPAA).
