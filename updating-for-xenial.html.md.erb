title: Updating FIM to Run with Xenial Stemcells
owner: Security Engineering
---

<strong><%= modified_date %></strong>

Pivotal Cloud Foundry (PCF) products and tiles that are released after July 2018 require
Ubuntu Xenial stemcells instead of Ubuntu Trusty stemcells.
You might have to modify your <%= vars.product_full %> (<%= vars.product_abbr %>) deployment
if you use PCF products running on Xenial.

This topic describes how to determine if your existing deployment of
<%= vars.product_abbr %> can monitor VMs that run on Xenial.

This topic also explains how to update your <%= vars.product_abbr %> deployment
if it does not support Xenial.

Follow the instructions on this page if you use <%= vars.product_abbr %> with
any PCF products or tiles that use Xenial stemcells. For more information,
see [Product Tiles that Use Xenial Stemcells](#which) below.

##<a id="who-me"></a<a id="who-me"></a> Do I Need to Modify <%= vars.product_abbr %>?

<%= vars.product_abbr %> v1.2.22 and later can run correctly on Xenial-based VMs
if the <%= vars.product_abbr %> runtime config includes the `ubuntu-xenial` property.

Review the following table and make any required changes before you upgrade to Xenial stemcells.

<table class="nice">
    <col width="25%">
    <col width="75%">
    <th>If you use this version of <%= vars.product_abbr %>…</td>
    <th>do the following…</td>
    <tr>
      <td>1.2.23+</td>
      <td>Verify that your runtime config file, <code>fim.yml</code>, includes:
<pre>
  - name: fim-trusty
    include:
      stemcell:
      - os: ubuntu-trusty

  - name: fim-xenial
    include:
      stemcell:
      - os: ubuntu-xenial
</pre>
        If the <code>fim.yml</code> file does not include the above, then follow the steps in
        <a href="#add">Add the Xenial Stemcell Property to <%= vars.product_abbr %></a> below.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>v1.2.22</td>
      <td>Follow the steps in <a href="#add">Add the Xenial Stemcell Property to <%= vars.product_abbr %></a></a> below.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>v1.2.17 or earlier</td>
      <td>Install <%= vars.product_abbr %></a> v1.2.23 or later. For instructions, see <a href="installing.html">Installing <%= vars.product_short %></a></a>.</td>
    </tr>
</table>

If you use <%= vars.product_abbr %> without adding the `ubuntu-xenial` property
to the runtime config, the VMs running on Xenial are not being monitored for file integrity.

If you add the `ubuntu-xenial` property but do not upgrade <%= vars.product_abbr %>
to v1.2.22 or later, then the <%= vars.product_abbr %> processes use excessive CPU.

## <a id="which"></a> Product Tiles that Use Xenial Stemcells

Ensure that you have added the `ubuntu-xenial` property to the <%= vars.product_abbr %>
runtime config before you install any product tiles that use Xenial stemcells.

For a list of PCF tile releases that now use Xenial,
see [Tiles Using Xenial Stemcells in PCF](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/stemcells/xenial-tiles.html).

##<a id="add"></a> Add the Xenial Stemcell Property to <%= vars.product_abbr %>

If you use <%= vars.product_abbr %> v1.2.22 or v1.2.23 without the stemcell
property in the `fim.yml`, then you must add the stemcell properties to your
existing `fim.yml` and redeploy:

1. SSH in to the Ops Manager VM.
   For how to do this, see [SSH into Ops Manager](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/customizing/trouble-advanced.html#ssh).

2. To retrieve and save <%= vars.product_abbr %> runtime config, run:

    ```
    bosh -e BOSH-ENVIRONMENT runtime-config –name fim > /tmp/fim.yml
    ```

    Where `BOSH-ENVIRONMENT` is the alias you set for the BOSH Director.

    For example:

    <pre class="terminal">$ bosh -e my-env runtime-config –name fim > /tmp/fim.yml </pre>


3. Edit the `fim.yml` file:

    ```
    addons:
    - name: fim-trusty
      jobs:
      - name: fim
        release: fim
        properties: {}
      include:
        stemcell:
        - os: ubuntu-trusty
    - name: fim-xenial
      jobs:
      - name: fim
        release: fim
        properties:
          fim:
            dirs:
              # System binaries and configuration
              - /bin
              - /etc
              - /lib
              - /lib32
              - /lib64
              - /opt
              - /sbin
              - /srv
              - /usr
              - /var/lib

              # BOSH agent
              - /var/vcap/bosh
              - /var/vcap/monit/job

              # BOSH releases
              - /var/vcap/data/packages
              - /var/vcap/data/jobs
      include:
        stemcell:
        - os: ubuntu-xenial
    ```
    <p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: If you customized your Trusty VMs configuration, you need to manually add the <code>/lib32</code> directory to your <code>fim.yml</code> file.
    </p>

4. To update the runtime config, run the following command:

    ```
    bosh -e BOSH-ENVIRONMENT update-runtime-config --name=fim /tmp/fim.yml
    ```

    For example:

    <pre class="terminal">bosh -e my-env update-runtime-config --name=fim /tmp/fim.yml</pre>

5. Navigate to the **Installation Dashboard** in Ops Manager.

6. Click **Review Pending Changes**.
   For more information about this Ops Manager page,
   see [Reviewing Pending Product Changes](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/customizing/review-pending-changes.html).

7. Click **Apply Changes**.
